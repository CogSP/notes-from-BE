- RP Robot: dynamic model, redundancy (one-dimensional task) -> pseudoinverse
	- weight matrix $W$ to compare $\tau$ revolute joint torque and prismatic joint force
	- null space method to not build up joint velocities (TODO: check if this is actually the null space method)

## September 2010 (2010-09)
- RPR Robot: find inertia matrix and minimal set of dynamic coefficients
	- **TODO**: understand how these coefficients are found
