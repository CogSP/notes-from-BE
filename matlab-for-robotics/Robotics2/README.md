# matlab-for-robotics - Robotics 2

- RP Robot: dynamic model, redundancy (one-dimensional task) -> pseudoinverse
	- weight matrix $W$ to compare $\tau$ revolute joint torque and prismatic joint force
	- null space method to not build up joint velocities (TODO: check if this is actually the null space method)
