## Bachelor's degree in Computer and Control Engineering ("Ingegneria informatica ed Automatica"), Sapienza, 2020-2023

- **BE-thesis**: I am currently writing my thesis "Analisi del Traffico delle Reti Wireless con Grafana: Implementazione e Tecniche di Monitoraggio in Tempo Reale"

- **psico-dama**: made for the "Linguaggi e Tecnologie per il Web" exam, _PsicoDAMA_ is a game of checkers with special psychedelic effects.

- **ML-models-AI-agents**: made for the "Fondamenti di Intelligenza Artificiale" exam, consists of two parts:
   - models-of-ML: from-scratch implementations of several fundamentals ML models (such as Neural Net, DT, ...) for both classification and regression task on an online news popularity dataset
   - AI agents: pathfinding with A* algorithm (in progress)

- **net-simulation**: made for the "Telecomunicazioni" exam, consists of two projects done using *ns3*, *Wireshark* and *NetAnim*: 
   - implement a CSMA + P2P simulation with ns3 and analyze traffic performance with Wireshark 
   - implement two WLAN simulation with ns3, ana√≤yze traffic performance with Wireshark and make a visualization of the traffic with NetAnim. The two simulations are:
      - WLAN Ad-hoc mode with RTS/CTS 
      - WLAN Infrastructure mode

- **notes-from-BE**: some notes I have taken to learn how to write LaTeX. "Ingegneria Informatica e Automatica", Sapienza, 2020-2023
